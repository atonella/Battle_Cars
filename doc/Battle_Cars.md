# Battle Cars

## Principle
Battle Cars is a top down perspective game, where the player drives a car and has to shoot down other cars.
Each car is equipped with a canon on the front.
Randomly spawned power-ups can be collected to make the game more intersting and diverse.


## Design Choices
- 2 game modes:
    - Singleplayer (Player 1 vs. COM)
    - Multiplayer (Player 1 vs Player 2)
- Game stats on top
- Time indicator intecrated in game stats


## Current Features
Nothing.

## Future Ideas
The following are some ideas I came up with during concept phase and development.

### Power-ups
Power-ups do spawn randomly and can be collected by the player.
#### Buff
- Shrink
- Canon: Double, Triple, Laser
- Faster
- Increase Health/Armor

#### Nerf
- Increase size
- Slow Down
- No Canon for x seconds
